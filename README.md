i have created Machine Learning Model which predicts quality of wine using dataset from kaggle site.
performed the model using classification method and used gradient boosting techniques to predict the values.
Model was created in colab and used ngrok and flask ,i have deployed using API.
Using the link which will be provided by ngrok, i predicted the values by giving the sample input to the model in postman.
